<p>When you try to build your personal Blog as a developer there's a bunch of new and old cool frameworks and tools that you could use, each of them has their advantages and disadvantages, and this is just a demo project to review Astro's features</p>
<h5>Well, it's compatibility with different Content Management Systems is pretty high, but i guess Next JS would be a better option on my use case, since it's offers :</h5>
✅ Ready Code Blocks <br>
✅ More rich Content with MDX <br>
<i>MDX supports to import React component and embed it directly as markdown content. (Youtube,Instagram,Twitter content ...)</i>

<p>
  Astro Islands represent a leading paradigm shift for frontend web architecture. Astro extracts your UI into smaller, isolated components on the page. Unused JavaScript is replaced with lightweight HTML, guaranteeing faster loads and time-to-interactive (TTI).

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
